### Covers and Scribus

Download Scribus 1.4.6 https://www.scribus.net/scribus-1-4-6-released/

Install fonts. Once you have dowloaded the repository you will find these fonts locally  https://github.com/mrchristian/hazards/tree/master/fonts

Note: cover items are in layers, so you need to be on the right layer to edit
